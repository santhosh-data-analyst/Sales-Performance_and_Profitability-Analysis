# Business Findings & Recommendations  
**Sales Performance & Profitability Analysis (Power BI)**

This document summarizes the key business findings derived from the Power BI dashboard
and translates analytical insights into clear, actionable recommendations.

The objective is not reporting, but **decision support**.

## Executive Summary

Sales growth alone is not translating into sustainable profitability.  
While overall revenue has increased, profit erosion is evident at both **product** and
**customer** levels, primarily driven by discounting practices and structurally
unprofitable segments.

Immediate corrective action is required to prevent further profit leakage.

## Page 1 – Sales Performance Overview  
**Question answered:** *Is the business healthy overall?*

### Key Findings
- Revenue growth remains strong across the analyzed period.
- Profit trends diverge from revenue in recent periods, indicating margin compression.
- Certain regions generate high sales volumes but contribute disproportionately low profit.

### Business Implication
Top-line growth is masking underlying profitability issues. Management should avoid
relying solely on revenue as a performance indicator.

## Page 2 – Product Profitability Analysis  
**Question answered:** *Which products create value vs destroy value?*

### Key Findings
- A small subset of products accounts for a disproportionate share of total profit.
- Several high-revenue products operate at or below break-even, contributing to profit drag.
- Low-margin products dilute overall portfolio profitability despite strong sales volumes.

### Business Implication
The product portfolio requires rationalization. Revenue concentration without margin
discipline increases operational risk.

### Recommended Actions
- **Scale:** Products with strong margins and consistent profitability.
- **Fix:** Products near break-even through pricing, cost, or sourcing optimization.
- **Drop:** Persistently unprofitable products with no clear path to margin recovery.

## Page 3 – Customer & Discount Profitability Analysis  
**Question answered:** *Where is profit leaking, and why?*

### Key Findings
- A clear inverse relationship exists between **discount levels** and **profit margins**.
- Customers receiving discounts above the 20% threshold are significantly more likely to be loss-making.
- A subset of customers remains unprofitable even at low discount levels, indicating
  structural pricing or servicing cost issues.
- High-revenue customers with negative margins represent the **highest financial risk**.

### Quantified Impact
- **Customers in Profit Leakage Zone:** Significant portion of active customers
- **Revenue at Risk:** Material share of total revenue
- **Profit Leakage:** Substantial negative contribution to overall profitability

### Business Implication
Profit leakage is primarily driven by **pricing discipline failures** rather than volume decline.
Not all revenue is good revenue.

## Customer Action Framework

Customers are classified into four actionable categories:

### Protect
- Low discount
- Positive margin  
**Action:** Maintain pricing discipline and relationship stability.

### Monitor
- High discount
- Positive margin  
**Action:** Gradually tighten discounts without jeopardizing volume.

### Renegotiate
- Low discount
- Negative margin  
**Action:** Reassess pricing structure, service levels, or contract terms.

### Drop
- High discount
- Negative margin  
**Action:** Immediate intervention; renegotiate aggressively or exit.

## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Enforce Discount Governance**
   - Implement approval thresholds beyond 20%.
   - Monitor discount creep at customer level, not transaction level.

2. **Shift Performance Evaluation**
   - Move from revenue-based KPIs to margin- and contribution-based KPIs.
   - Align sales incentives with profitability, not volume alone.

3. **Customer Portfolio Optimization**
   - Prioritize retention of profitable, low-discount customers.
   - Reduce exposure to high-revenue but loss-making accounts.

4. **Product Portfolio Rationalization**
   - Eliminate structurally unprofitable products.
   - Focus investment on high-margin categories.

## Final Note

This analysis demonstrates that profitability issues are **controllable**, not structural.
By enforcing pricing discipline and focusing on value-generating customers and products,
the business can improve margins without sacrificing sustainable growth.

The dashboard is designed to support **ongoing monitoring and decision-making**, not
one-time reporting.
